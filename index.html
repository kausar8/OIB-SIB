                    Dr.A.P.J.abdul kalam After completing his degree at the Madras University of Technology in 1960, he joined DRDO in Aeronautics Development Establishment as a scientist.
                     He designed a small aircraft as the first scientific work of his career. Still, as he wasn't satisfied with his job, he also started working in other places like the INCOSPAR 
                     committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, well known Indian Scientist.In 1963 Kalam Joined the Indian Space Research Organization as the Project Director of India's First Satellite

                        In 2002, Kalam was chosen as the 11th President of India. He was chosen as a candidate for Presidency; he and NDA both were popular and in power at that time; all
                         other candidates backed him, so it was a clear win for him. On 25 July, Kalam moved to Rashtrapati Bhavan after taking the oath.

                        As a President, APJ Abdul Kalam made many tough decisions and was loved by people. He also won the label of "People's President". The toughest judgment of his life was 
                        when he signed an office of Profit Bill. He was criticised when he accepted the mercy plead of 20 people out of 21, but the one he rejected was guilty of rape. One petition
                         he delayed was of Afzal Guru, who was accused of the December 2001 Parliament Attacks but later in 2014, he was hung. A different argument his decision caught was of striking Pres
                         ident's Rule in Bihar in 2005 for a week.

                        on the 27th of July, 2015. While getting down the stairs, he felt little uneasiness, but he still went to the auditorium after taking little rest. At around 6:35, he collapsed down, and it was just 5 minutes of his lecture. He was taken to the "Bethany Hospital" in critical condition; there was a lack of pulses, and he had no sign of life.
